         Franklyn M. Branley, Comets, Meteoroids, and Asteroids: Mavericks of
         the Solar System: <i>Meteorites and probably all meteoroids contain
         the same materials as those contained in the earth itself.</i>

         Alex N. Halliday, "Inside the Cosmic Blender" <i>Modern mass
         spectrometry techniques had revealed that the isotopic compositions
         of many of the more refractory elements in meteorites, including a
         primitive class of meteorite called chondrites, are, within error,
         identical to those found on Earth itself.</i>

         Gordon A. Macdonald et al., Volcanoes in the Sea, 2nd edition: <i>The
         thousands of meteorites that strike the earth each year are
         generally believed to be either fragments of a disrupted planet (or
         planets) that originally resembled the earth, or bits of cosmic “dust”
         such as originally were gathered together to form the earth</i>
